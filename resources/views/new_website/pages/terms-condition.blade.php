        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Terms & Conditions</h2>
        <h3>Agreement</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Participants must be at least 21 years of age to play in the Square Jungle Super Bowl
                Pool.</li>
            <li>No Overtime/Tie Breakers will be considered in the game.</li>
            <li>Participation in Square Jungle is based on an honor system, implying a commitment to
                play upon selection.</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>Square Selection</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Players must select two categories and are committed to playing both boards.</li>
            <li>Once a square is selected, it cannot be changed; the cell is locked under the player's
                Alias.</li>
            <li>Payment is only required when the board is completely filled; the board will be inactive
                for payment until then.</li>
            <h3>Board Administration</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The admin reserves the right to determine the number of boards and which game will
                    be played.</li>
                <li>Weekly picks are the responsibility of each player, and timely submissions are crucial.
                    Missed deadlines may result in non-reopening of the board, except in specific
                    circumstances outlined below.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Reopening Board</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the deadline is missed, the admin may re-open the board one last time if there are
                    only a few open squares, and this will be announced.</li>
                <li>If the board still has open squares after the second period, it will be canceled and
                    closed.</li>
                <li>Participation in Square Jungle is based on an honor system, implying a commitment to
                    play upon selection.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>Payment and Player Conduct</h3>
            <p>Payment is expected during the open period. If a player's name is removed three times from
                squares due to non-payment after the deadline, they will be locked out and removed from the
                website. This ensures fairness to other potential players.</p>
            <h3>Game Rules</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Two board options: - 10x10_4 board: 100 squares with four quarters, each having a new
                    number generated. - 10x10_1 board: 100 squares with one set of generated numbers
                    for all four quarters (subject to vote). 13. A 10x10_4 board consists of 4 rows and 4
                    columns numbered from 0 to 9. A 10x10_1 board has 1 row and 1 column with numbers
                    from 0 to 9. 14. A total of 100 equally priced squares are available for purchase.</li>
                <li>Players can buy as many squares as they wish (subject to vote).</li>
                <li>At the end of each quarter, the winning square corresponds to the intersection of the
                    row and column with matching numbers.</li>
                <li>Prize payouts will be posted online after the game concludes.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By participating in Square Jungle, players agree to abide by these terms and conditions. The

                changes.</p>
